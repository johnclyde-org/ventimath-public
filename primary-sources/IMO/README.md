# International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)

The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the world championship mathematics competition for high school students. It is held annually in a different country.

## Contents

### Competition Problems (`problems/`)

Official IMO competition papers in multiple languages (1132 PDFs across 63 languages).
Each PDF contains the 6 problems given to contestants at that year's IMO.

Organized by language code (e.g., `problems/eng/`, `problems/fre/`, `problems/spa/`).
Files are named `IMO{YEAR}.pdf` (e.g., `IMO2024.pdf`).

Coverage:
- `eng/` (English): 1959-2025 (66 files, complete)
- `fre/` (French): 1979, 1997, 2006-2025 (22 files)
- `spa/` (Spanish): 2003-2025 (23 files)
- Most other languages: 2006-2025 (~20 files each)

Note: The 1980 IMO in Mongolia was canceled; there is no problem set for that year.

### Shortlists (`shortlists/`)

IMO Shortlist PDFs from 2006-2024. Each shortlist contains:
- Proposed problems organized by category (Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, Number Theory)
- Full solutions
- Problem selection information

Files are named `IMO{YEAR}SL.pdf` (e.g., `IMO2024SL.pdf`)

### IMO Compendium (`imo-compendium.pdf`)

A comprehensive collection of IMO problems from 1959-2012, including a significant amount of **longlist and shortlist material not available on the official IMO website**. This includes:
- All competition problems with solutions
- Shortlisted problems (many not published elsewhere)
- Longlisted problems from earlier years
- Historical context and problem selection notes
