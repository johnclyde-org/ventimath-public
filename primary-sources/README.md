# Primary Sources

This folder contains primary source materials from various math competitions—PDFs, images, and original documents provided by contest organizers. The purpose is to maintain a canonical archive so we don't have to repeatedly crawl websites to verify problem accuracy.

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific contest and includes attribution information for the contest owners.

All materials are collected with the intent of proper attribution and respect for copyright. If you represent a contest organization and have concerns, please open an issue.
