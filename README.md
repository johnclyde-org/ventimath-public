# VentiMath

**A comprehensive resource for competitive mathematics**

VentiMath is a project by John Clyde (IMO 1997 - USA) to organize and centralize the wealth of math contest information currently scattered across the web. The goal is to create a single, well-attributed repository of problems, solutions, and resources for students, coaches, and enthusiasts of mathematical olympiads and competitions.

## About the Project

The competitive math community has accumulated decades of valuable content—past contest problems, solutions, training materials, and historical records—but this information is fragmented across countless websites, forums, and archives. VentiMath aims to bring order to this chaos while respecting copyright and providing proper attribution for all materials.

### GrindOlympiads

[GrindOlympiads](https://github.com/johnclyde/grindolympiads), a former project focused on olympiad problem practice, has been brought under the VentiMath umbrella. Similar to how Beast Academy operates as part of Art of Problem Solving, GrindOlympiads continues to exist as a component of the broader VentiMath initiative.

### ARML Connection

As of 2025, John serves as an acting coach of Washington State ARML (WARML). A key objective of VentiMath is to provide tools and resources that benefit WARML participants as well as ARML teams from other states and regions.

## Built with AI

This project leans heavily on agentic AI to tackle the enormous scope of organizing decades of math contest content in a reasonable timeframe. Tools include:

- Claude Code (Anthropic)
- OpenAI Codex
- Various open-source LLMs via OpenRouter

## Attribution & Copyright

VentiMath is committed to proper attribution and respect for copyright. All materials collected will include clear sourcing and licensing information. If you are a content creator and have concerns about how your materials are being used, please open an issue or contact us directly.
